# This is a python script solving diffusion PDE, d phi / d t = D d^2 phi / d x^2, in 1-d using kinetic Monte Carlo method. 
# The data is compared to the analytical solution in the plot. 
# Certainly, increasing number of sample would improve the accuracy of the KMC simulation.

L = N-1;   # System size, scaling
h = L/float(N-1) /2.  # Grid spacing, divided by 2 since for even number of moves and starting from origin, you won't stop at, say, the first grid to the right. So we only record those grids that will have particles at the end of simulation, or we allow the particle to move half of the grid spacing for a single step.

# Constants
# The timescale for a particle to diffuse to the nearest neighbor is tau ~ h^2/D and thus
# the rate for the diffusive process is k = 1/tau

D = 1; # Diffusion coefficient, also used in the analytical solution

kplus = D/h**2; # Rate that the particle moves to the right
kminus = D/h**2; # Rate that the particle moves to the left

# Constructing the cumulative rate vetor
