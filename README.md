Protein Aggregation <br />

Consider in a tube or in a cell, there are whole bunch of proteins floating in it. These proteins has tendency to bind with 
each other and thus they could form protein aggregation (PA).

Short-term goal, a warm-up for using KMC: <br />
Solving one dimensional diffusion equation using KMC. <br />

The diffustion equation reads <br />
d phi / dt = D^2 d^2 phi / dx^2. 

**Consider a particle is placed on a lattice with N grids. The particle can either go right or left with half of a grid spacing h with the same rate k. 
**The relation between the transition rate and the diffusion coefficient is<br />
k = D / h^2.

**Now let each sample runs for a while and then plot the number of particles on the grid. This could compare to the analytical solution, which read as probability distribution in this context.<br />
