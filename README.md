Protein Aggregation <br />

Consider in a tube or in a cell, there are whole bunch of proteins floating in it. These proteins has tendency to bind with 
each other and thus they could form protein aggregation (PA).  


Timeline <br />

Short-term goal, a warm-up for using KMC: <br />
Solving one dimensional diffusion equation using KMC. <br />
